A simple local client and server using usocket, based on the book
Land of Lisp - Chapter 12.  http://landoflisp.com

To get running, ensure you have usocket, then start an instance of your REPL. Load the server script
Then start a second REPL and LISP instance, into this load the client.  Both instances should now be
connected via the my-stream parameter.  The connection is bi-directional, and you should be able to send
and recieve messages via the stream-read and stream-print commands.
